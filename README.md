Wave 2 of the Covid Pandemic has really brought down India's infrastructure, with people getting affected left and right every day, resources are scarce and the ones available are not known by the public. In order to tackle this decentalisation of data, we've developed https://covidsupport.xyz, a website where public data on various resources is aggregated and listed for anyone who might need them. For everyone's convenience phone numbers are automatically extracted from the text and listed separately from where the user can directly call or WhatsApp them.

We are in the process of improving the city list as well as the data sources as each hour passes but we hope that people who are in genuine need of resources find our website useful.

Stay Safe Everyone!
